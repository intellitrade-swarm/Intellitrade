## 📈 Expected Performance

### Trading Activity:
- **Scans**: 96 market analyses per day (per agent)
- **Trades**: 2-5 high-confidence trades per day (per agent)
- **Win Rate Target**: 55-65%
- **Average Hold Time**: 2-8 hours

### Profit Targets:
| Scenario | Daily Return | Weekly Return | Monthly Return |
|----------|--------------|---------------|----------------|
| Conservative | 5-10% | 35-70% | 150-300% |
| Moderate | 10-20% | 70-140% | 300-600% |
| Aggressive | 20%+ | 140%+ | 600%+ |

*With leverage and compounding effects*

### Example Trade Calculation:
```
Capital: $70 (30% of $236 balance)
Leverage: 10x
Position Value: $700

ETH moves 5%:
Profit = $700 × 5% = $35
ROI on Capital = 50% per trade

3 winning trades per day = 150% daily return
(Before accounting for losses and risk management)
```

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Smart Trading Behavior:
- ✅ **Agents may HOLD frequently** - This is GOOD!
- ✅ **Quality over quantity** - Only high-probability trades
- ✅ **Patient capital** - Waiting for optimal setups
- ✅ **Risk-first approach** - Capital preservation priority

### Market Conditions:
- Best performance in trending/volatile markets
- May trade less in ranging/choppy conditions
- Will sit out when no clear opportunities
- This selective approach maximizes win rate

### Realistic Expectations:
- Not every 15-minute cycle produces a trade
- 2-5 trades per agent per day is normal
- High win rate more important than trade frequency
- Patience leads to better results
